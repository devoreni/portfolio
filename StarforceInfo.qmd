# Background

## What is Starforce?
Starforce is a system used in the game MapleStory to enhance equipment (like weapons and armor) by adding stars to them. Each star increases the item's stats, making it stronger. However, the process of enhancing with Starforce is risky, costly, and influenced by many factors.

## The Basics of Starforce Enhancement:
* Starting Point: Items begin with 0 stars.
* Goal: Players aim to add stars, up to a maximum of 25.
* Costs: Each attempt costs mesos (the game's currency). Higher item level and star count increase the cost.
* Success, Fail, or Break:
    + Success: The item gains a star.
    + Failure: The attempt fails, and sometimes the item loses a star.
    + Destruction: At certain star levels, failure destroys the item unless special protections are used (which cost even more mesos).

## Cost Complexity
Starforcing is extremely complex and cannot be fully explained for the sake of brevity. If you wish to read more about the starforce system you can do so [here.](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/MapleStory/Spell_Trace_and_Star_Force) The current best solution people had to understanding how much it would cost to upgrade their item is by using an online calculator that will simulate their item many times and return statistics like mean and median costs, the number of destructions they can expect, etc. This is a poor solution to me for several reasons. Firstly, it takes time to run potentially thousands of simulations if you want an accurate result due to high variance. So long in some cases that there is a warning at the top of the site that the simulator may crash if you attempt to simulate items above 22 stars. Secondly, every time you will get a different result so you can only know a ballpark answer. Third, because it is so difficult to enhance above 22 stars, the simulator cannot handle it in most cases even for a single simulation so getting an evaluation is impossible.<br><br>
I set out to solve all three of these issues. I wanted my calculator to run quickly, be 100% accurate and return the same answer every time, and have the ability to calculate all star counts no matter what.

# Solution
After a month of working on this single project I was able to come up with a solution that made heavy use of mathematic, statistical, and computer science techniques. I first had to come up with a way to represent every possiblity in a recursive equation because infinite loops are possible. Next I had to simpllify, reduce, and solve that equation for the expected cost of getting to the next star which previously was a function of itself. The, I had to use dynamic programming to solve from the bottom up from star 0 to account for item destructions. Lastly I summed the costs from the starting star to desired star, and made everything presentable with a GUI.
